    <h1>1.Arizona</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>CREATIVITY is the first thing that comes to mind everytime I see the arizona state  website which is why this is my favorite state. Instead of being like every other state's website by putting all the main info in tabs at the top of the website. Arizona put the most important aspects of their state in boxes which you can click on the arrows to go from one to the next. The website is very visual instead of being filled with a bunch of words all over the home page.</li>
        <li>The background image has an orange tab that gives a brief explanation of whatever the image might be.(e.g the background is the boulder dam if the tab is clicked on a brief explanation of the boulder dam pops up.</li>
        <li>Pictures are attached to almost every tab or link on the main page.</li>
        <li>No problems having this website on my phone or tablet or any devices it is a responsive website.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.Montana</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The background was the first thing to really stick out, I noticed that before anything else, also like how it changes every time you return back to the website.</li>
        <li>Unlike all the other websites the first section is really just pictures of montana to give whoever on the website a sense of what montana presents year round.</li>
        <li>There are a bunch of resources very visible right under web gallery that are very easy to find and access as long as weekly news.</li>
        <li>Website is responsive easy to use on any electronic device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.Nebraska</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Between Nebraska and New Hampshire it was hard picking what state should come third  but what got me was just the creativity used in the nebraska website, with the graphs as the first thing seen and the different colors used all over the website. </li>
        <li>This is the only state website with their social media on the front page which is different than normal but something I thought was very cool. </li>
        <li>There is very good spacing in throughout the website making everything very easy to read and everything is very easy to find and access. </li>
        <li>The home page is a too short not enough is one the front page to really make it grab someone's attention, not enough information about the state is put on the home page.</li>
    </ul>
        
        <p>Check out <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/"  target="_new" title="My new title">Nebraska</a>.</p>
        
    <h4>4.New Hampshire</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The thing I like most about this state website is that it offers a list of common questions people normally ask right when you get onto the page which can be very useful and much easier to do then looking through a bunch of tabs to find an anything somebody might be looking for.</li>
        <li>The colors are really dull and basic which is one of the reasons I put it down as 4th best, they just werent the best colors to use. Majority of the home page is just the color white kind of boring compared to the other websites. </li>
        <li>A lot more effort putting into other parts of the website e.g Official Tourism website which has lots of color and different background images.</li>
        <li>This website is not responsive which is not good for smaller platforms like phones, tablets etc.</li>
    </ul>
        
        <p>Check out <a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm"  target="_new" title="My new title">New Hampshire</a>.</p>
    
    <h5>5.Alaska</h5>
    
    <ul>
        <li>This website was put last because the first thing I noticed was it was a little to hard to read what was on the home page the text was too little, and all these different tabs were all clogged up all in one place and its very hard to navigate through all that. </li>
        <li>The design was just flat out very plan and basic, majority blue just doesn't really catch they eye as multiple different colors with detail in them do.</li>
        <li>This website is not responsive.</li>
        <li>All four other websites have a governement tab that you can visibly see at the top of the page but this state website just didn't have all that. Not much positive to write about this state making it my least favorite.
        </li>
