<h1>Website Analysis Paper</h1>

<h2>Bad website</h2> 
<p>I think its better we start with the worst website and make our way to the two good quality ones. This website's color scheme has a 90s vibe but these are absolutely the worst colors for the eyes. The background color combined with the font colors are the worst mix giving off way too many bright colors all together. These colors are not used effectively and this site's product is x-rays which does not go with light blue, green and yellow font. All though the navigation is front and center the site itself is clustered and crowded. After the title, there is a brief description of the x-ray company and the font color is purple which is different from the font color of the title. I read through the website and I kind of got frustrated with how there was no logical flow throughout the whole website. Reading the content on the website was difficult as well there was no definition everything was kind of just put on the front page with no brief explanations on some of the things that they have to offer. The other parts of the website are empty and contain not very much information but a couple links. I can not navigate around this website well at all definitely very confusing and not clear at all. The other pages of this website are very disorganized and have barely any content on them.

    <h2>Good website #1</h2>
<p>This website is definitely my favorite out of the two because it is highly interactive, the homepage of the site starts off with a three-dimensional design of each chocolate bar. To me this is one of the coolest things ever and to other internet users seeing this makes you want to stay on the website and explore to see what other interesting cool things you can find. Its navigation bar isn’t the first thing you see when you get on the page but that doesnt mean the website is hard to navigate through or not clear. Each link on the navigation bar is very colorful, they are all different, with lots of information and is visually friendly to internet users. A couple things that stood out to me were text formatting it is a lot different compared to the numerous websites I have seen and also the cool icon of having a 3D design on each chocolate bar they have to offer. The code of this website is pretty clean for the most part and modern using footer,div, nav, and headers etc and the site using HTML5 elements.

        <h2>Good website #2</h2>
<p>My Second favorite website out of the two is only second because of my addiction to chocolate but this website for the most part is very VERY interactive. This was done intentionally even though the goal is to build awareness around deforestation this site allows users to "visit" the various villages, natives, and waterways that make up the Amazon Rainforest. The color scheme matches exactly with what the “product” or in this case getting people to become a protector of a part of the rainforest and the site only uses one MAJOR color which is dark green. This website uses div id, and headers,and does have HTML5 elements. Some things that really stood out to me where the cool icons that popped up representing who was a protector of what. There isn’t very much to talk about because the website isn’t in depth like that which is another thing I like is that it’s very simple and straight to the point. The whole 3D design of the map on the homepage really gave me the curiosity to stay on the website and see what I could fine and if there were any other interesting features other than just the map.  <a link href="http://rainforest.arkivert.no/#kart">Deforestation website.</a> This website was great.</p>
